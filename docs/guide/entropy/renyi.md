# RÃ©nyi Entropy Estimation

The RÃ©nyi entropy is a generalization of the Shannon entropy that includes a parameter $\alpha$ that controls the sensitivity of the entropy to the probabilities of the different states of the random variable {cite:p}``.

The RÃ©nyi entropy is defined as:

$$
H_\alpha(X) = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \log \left( \sum_{x \in X} p(x)^\alpha \right)
$$

[//]: # (please check the formula)

where $X$ is the set of possible values of the random variable, $p(x)$ is the probability of the value $x$ occurring, and $\alpha$ is the parameter that controls the sensitivity of the entropy.

AlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi was a Hungarian mathematician who made significant contributions to probability theory, information theory, and combinatorics. He is known for the RÃ©nyi entropy, RÃ©nyi divergence, and RÃ©nyi's parking constants.

For $\alpha = 1$, the RÃ©nyi entropy reduces to the Shannon entropy.
Proof is left as an exercise to the reader ðŸ˜†. (I think it needs $\sum_{x \in X} p(x) = 1$ to work)

```{code-cell}
import infomeasure as im
im.entropy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], approach="renyi", alpha=2)
```


The estimator is implemented in the {py:class}`RenyiEntropyEstimator <infomeasure.measures.entropy.renyi.RenyiEntropyEstimator>` class,
which is part of the {py:mod}`im.measures.entropy <infomeasure.measures.entropy>` module.

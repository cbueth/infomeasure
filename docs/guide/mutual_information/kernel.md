# Kernel Mutual Information Estimation

Kernel density estimation (KDE) itself was already discussed in the {ref}`Kernel Entropy Estimation` section.
For mutual information, the kernel approach is similar to the entropy estimation, but...?



The estimator is implemented in the {py:class}`KernelMIEstimator <infomeasure.measures.mutual_information.kernel.KernelMIEstimator>` class,
which is part of the {py:mod}`im.measures.mutual_information <infomeasure.measures.mutual_information>` module.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: infomeasure.measures.mutual_information.kernel.KernelMIEstimator
    :noindex:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

# Reference Guide
-----------------

On these pages you can find documentation for `infomeasure`.
The {ref}`Estimator Usage` explains the by-design usage of the package,
while the following pages describe the implemented information-theoretic measures like Entropy (H), Mutual Information (MI), Conditional MI, Transfer Entropy (TE), Conditional TE, etc. for both the discrete and continuous-valued data and by using several estimation techniques (eg: Kernel method, Kraskov-Stögbauer-Grassberger method, etc).
For the detailed API documentation, see the {ref}`API Reference`.

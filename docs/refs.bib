  abstract = {Functional networks have emerged as powerful instruments to characterize the propagation of information in complex systems, with applications ranging from neuroscience to climate and air transport. In spite of their success, reliable methods for validating the resulting structures are still missing, forcing the community to resort to expert knowledge or simplified models of the system's dynamics. We here propose the use of a real-world problem, involving the reconstruction of the structure of flights in the US air transport system from the activity of individual airports, as a way to explore the limits of such an approach. While the true connectivity is known and is, therefore, possible to provide a quantitative benchmark, this problem presents challenges commonly found in other fields, including the presence of non-stationarities and observational noise, and the limitedness of available time series. We explore the impact of elements like the specific functional metric employed, the way of detrending the time series, or the size of the reconstructed system and discuss how the conclusions here drawn could have implications for similar analyses in neuroscience.}

This is done by examining their application to cellular automata, a classic complex system, where these local information profiles have provided quantitative evidence for long-held conjectures regarding the information transfer and processing role of gliders and glider collisions. Finally, we describe the outlook in anticipating the broad application of these local measures of information processing in computational neuroscience.",

    abstract = {In complex networks such as gene networks, traffic systems or brain circuits it is important to understand how long it takes for the different parts of the network to effectively influence one another. In the brain, for example, axonal delays between brain areas can amount to several tens of milliseconds, adding an intrinsic component to any timing-based processing of information. Inferring neural interaction delays is thus needed to interpret the information transfer revealed by any analysis of directed interactions across brain structures. However, a robust estimation of interaction delays from neural activity faces several challenges if modeling assumptions on interaction mechanisms are wrong or cannot be made. Here, we propose a robust estimator for neuronal interaction delays rooted in an information-theoretic framework, which allows a model-free exploration of interactions. In particular, we extend transfer entropy to account for delayed source-target interactions, while crucially retaining the conditioning on the embedded target state at the immediately previous time step. We prove that this particular extension is indeed guaranteed to identify interaction delays between two coupled systems and is the only relevant option in keeping with Wienerâ€™s principle of causality. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in detecting interaction delays on finite data by numerical simulations of stochastic and deterministic processes, as well as on local field potential recordings. We also show the ability of the extended transfer entropy to detect the presence of multiple delays, as well as feedback loops. While evaluated on neuroscience data, we expect the estimator to be useful in other fields dealing with network dynamics.},

  abstract = {Complex systems are increasingly being viewed as distributed information processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and artificial life. This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyze the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project, which provides a standalone (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g., entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information), it ultimately focuses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focuses on quantifying information storage, transfer, and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g., Gaussian, box-kernel, and Kraskov--St{\"o}gbauer--Grassberger), which can be swapped at run-time due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python, and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.},

    ABSTRACT = {We propose a new estimator to measure directed dependencies in time series. The dimensionality of data is first reduced using a new non-uniform embedding technique, where the variables are ranked according to a weighted sum of the amount of new information and improvement of the prediction accuracy provided by the variables. Then, using a greedy approach, the most informative subsets are selected in an iterative way. The algorithm terminates, when the highest ranked variable is not able to significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction as compared to that obtained using the existing selected subsets. In a simulation study, we compare our estimator to existing state-of-the-art methods at different data lengths and directed dependencies strengths. It is demonstrated that the proposed estimator has a significantly higher accuracy than that of existing methods, especially for the difficult case, where the data are highly correlated and coupled. Moreover, we show its false detection of directed dependencies due to instantaneous couplings effect is lower than that of existing measures. We also show applicability of the proposed estimator on real intracranial electroencephalography data.},

  abstract = {The fundamental building block of social influence is for one person to elicit a response in another. Researchers measuring a "response" in social media typically depend either on detailed models of human behavior or on platform-specific cues such as re-tweets, hash tags, URLs, or mentions. Most content on social networks is difficult to model because the modes and motivation of human expression are diverse and incompletely understood. We introduce content transfer, an information-theoretic measure with a predictive interpretation that directly quantifies the strength of the effect of one user's content on another's in a model-free way. Estimating this measure is made possible by combining recent advances in non-parametric entropy estimation with increasingly sophisticated tools for content representation. We demonstrate on Twitter data collected for thousands of users that content transfer is able to capture non-trivial, predictive relationships even for pairs of users not linked in the follower or mention graph. We suggest that this measure makes large quantities of previously under-utilized social media content accessible to rigorous statistical causal analysis.},

Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator.}

  abstract = {Estimating Shannon entropy and its exponential from incomplete samples is a central objective of many research fields. However, empirical estimates of Shannon entropy and its exponential depend strongly on sample size and typically exhibit substantial bias. This work uses a novel method to obtain an accurate, low-bias analytic estimator of entropy, based on species frequency counts. Our estimator does not require prior knowledge of the number of species. We show that there is a close relationship between Shannon entropy and the species accumulation curve, which depicts the cumulative number of observed species as a function of sample size. We reformulate entropy in terms of the expected discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is, the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. Our estimator is obtained by applying slope estimators derived from an improved Good-Turing frequency formula. Our method is also applied to estimate mutual information. Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that if sample size is not unreasonably small, the resulting entropy estimator is nearly unbiased. Our estimator generally outperforms previous methods in terms of bias and accuracy (low mean squared error) especially when species richness is large and there is a large fraction of undetected species in samples. We discuss the extension of our approach to estimate Shannon entropy for multiple incidence data. The use of our estimator in constructing an integrated rarefaction and extrapolation curve of entropy (or mutual information) as a function of sample size or sample coverage (an aspect of sample completeness) is also discussed.},

Our approach is based on comparing the entropy of the two samples. The difficulty lies in the fact that known estimators of entropy tend to have a large bias even when the sample size is fairly large. To deal with this, we suggest splitting the larger sample into several parts of length equal to the length of the smaller work. We then propose using these new sub-samples in a simple non-parametric test. We apply our methodology to test whether the poem ``Shall I Die?'' which is sometimes attributed to William Shakespeare was, in fact, written by him.}

  abstract = {A biological community usually has a large number of species with relatively small abundances. When a random sample of individuals is selected and each individual is classified according to species identity, some rare species may not be discovered. This paper is concerned with the estimation of Shannon's index of diversity when the number of species and the species abundances are unknown. The traditional estimator that ignores the missing species underestimates when there is a non-negligible number of unseen species. We provide a different approach based on unequal probability sampling theory because species have different probabilities of being discovered in the sample. No parametric forms are assumed for the species abundances. The proposed estimation procedure combines the Horvitz--Thompson (1952) adjustment for missing species and the concept of sample coverage, which is used to properly estimate the relative abundances of species discovered in the sample. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator works well under various abundance models even when a relatively large fraction of the species is missing. Three real data sets, two from biology and the other one from numismatics, are given for illustration.},

Estimating the entropy of discrete sequences can be challenging due to limited data and the lack of unbiased estimators. Most existing entropy estimators are designed for sequences of independent events and their performances vary depending on the system being studied and the available data size. In this work, we compare different entropy estimators and their performance when applied to Markovian sequences. Specifically, we analyze both binary Markovian sequences and Markovian systems in the undersampled regime. We calculate the bias, standard deviation, and mean squared error for some of the most widely employed estimators. We discuss the limitations of entropy estimation as a function of the transition probabilities of the Markov processes and the sample size. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive comparison of entropy estimators and their performance in estimating entropy for systems with memory, which can be useful for researchers and practitioners in various fields.},
